  Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and store the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
